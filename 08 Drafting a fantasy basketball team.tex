\maketitle

\section*{The problem}

You're preparing for your upcoming fantasy basketball draft. You wonder:
what is the best possible team you can draft?
You have the following data:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0ex,parsep=0.5ex]
  \item Projected \textbf{auction prices} for each player in the NBA.
  \item The \textbf{z-score} for each player: the sum of the number of
    standard deviations above the mean in the following 9 categories:
    \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
      \item points per 36 minutes
      \item 3 point field goals made per 36 minutes
      \item number of rebounds per 36 minutes
      \item number of assists per 36 minutes
      \item number of steals per 36 minutes
      \item number of blocks per 36 minutes
      \item \emph{negative} of the number of turnovers per 36 minutes
      \item field goal percentage
      \item free throw percentage
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Your roster must have exactly 12 players, and you have a budget of \$50.
You want to maximize the total z-score of your team.
Formulate this problem as a dynamic program by giving its
shortest/longest path representation.
